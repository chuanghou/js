#### Praise for JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, Seventh Edition

"This book is everything you never knew you wanted to know about javascript". Take your JavaScript code **_quality_** and productivity to the next level. David's knowledge of the language, its **_intricacies_** and **_gotchas_**, is **_astounding_**, and it **_shines_** through in this truly **_definitive_** guide to the JavaScript language."

"David Flanagan takes readers on a guided tour of JavaScript that will provide them with a **_feature-complete_** picture of the language and its **_ecosystem_**"
<p align="right">Sarah Wachs, Fronted Developer and Women Who Code Berlin Lead</p>

"Any Developer interested in being **_productive_** in **_codebases_** developed throughout JavaScript's lifetime(including the latest and **_emerging_** features) will be well served by a deep and **_reflective_** journey through this **_comprehensive_** and **_definitive_** book."

> gratitude 感谢

comprehensively and definitively
this a long and detailed book

My hope however, is that it will reward careful study and that the time you spend reading it wil be easily **_recouped_** in the form of higher programming productivity

I no longer feel that it makes sense to include that material in printed form when it is so quick and way to find up-to-date reference material online. look up anything related to core or client-side Javascript. MDN site

## Chapter 1. Introduction to JavaScript

The overwhelming majority of websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers--on desktop, tablets, and phones--include JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most-deployed programming language in history. 

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, **_interpreted programming language_** that is well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming styles.

Its syntax is loosely based in Java, but the languages are otherwise.

In chinese programmer network, there is a very famous joke about java and javascript. It says the relationship between java and javascript is like the relationship between Lei Feng and Leifeng tower. These two words share same prefix. But Leifeng is a soldier who is a model of morality, and Leifeng Tower is a famous tower based in Hangzhou, a city of China. There aren't any relationship between them like java and javascript.

The name JavaScript is **_quite misleading_**. Except for **_a superficial syntactic_** resemblance

JavaScript **_has long since outgrown its script-language roots_** to become a robust and efficient general-purpose language suitable for serious software engineering and projects with huge codebases.

To be useful, every language must have a platform, or standard library, for performing things like basic input and output.

The core JavaScript languages defines **_a minimal API for working with numbers, text, arrays, sets, maps_**, and so on, but does not include any input or output functionally.

But learning a new programming language is never a linear process, and describing a language is not linear either: each language feature is related to other features, and this book is full of cross-references-sometimes backward and sometime forward-to related material.

### 1.1 Exploring JavaScript
When learning a new programming language, it's important to try the examples in the book, then modify them and try time again to test your understanding of the language.

If JavaScript expressions are like phrases, then JavaScript statements are like full sentences. Statements are the topic of Chapter 5. Roughly, an expression is something that computes a value but doesn't do anything

In ES6 and later, there is shorthand syntax for defining functions, This concise syntax uses => to separate the argument list from the function body, so functions defined this way are known as arrow functions. 

The book explains JavaScript from the bottom up. This means that we start with low-level details like comments, identifiers, variables, and types; then build to expressions, statements, objects, and function; and then cover high-level languages abstractions like classes and modules. I take the world definitive in the title of this book seriously, and the coming chapters explain the languages at a level of detail that mat feel **_off-putting_**(令人不愉快的).

if you find yourself feeling bogged down in a section, simply skip to the next. You can come back and master the details once you have a working knowledge of the language as a whole.
