comprehensively and definitively
this a long and detailed book

My hope however, is that it will reward careful study and that the time you spend reading it wil be easily **_recouped_** in the form of higher programming productivity

I no longer feel that it makes sense to include that material in printed form when it is so quick and wasy to find up-to-date
